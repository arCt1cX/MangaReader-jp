# 🎉 Manga Reader PWA - Project Complete!

## 📁 What's Been Created

### Frontend PWA (MangaReader-jp folder)
✅ **Complete React PWA** with:
- Modern React 18 + React Router setup

# Your server code is ready! Just:
1. Push your Server-arct1cx changes to GitHub
2. Connect to Render.com
3. Add environment variables (see SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.txt)
```

### 2. Deploy Frontend (5 minutes)
```bash
# In MangaReader-jp folder:
npm install  # (you may need to enable script execution)

# Then enable GitHub Pages
```
